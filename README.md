# :sparkles: Celebrity Look-A-Fight :sparkles:

## Application Concept
Remember that show Celebrity Deathmatch on MTV? 10 years later, we are bringing a reboot but now we put you in the ring and will be in your corner every step of the way! 

## Motivation
To provide a fun & entertaining app where you will discover your celebrity look-a-like and then get to play an RPG themed game and battle against other celebrities.

## Design Process
Our team collaborated by using individual strengths to build our application using the MVC architecture. 

We used Trello task management, gitflow for seamless merging 
and Slack for team communication.
